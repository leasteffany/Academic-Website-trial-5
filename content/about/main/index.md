  I am Steffany. I was born on Sunday noon, February 11, 2001. I was raised in a small province in the Philippines, surrounded with nature and exposed to typhoons. I am a small girl with a height of 4'11 but will grow to 5'0 by the end of the year (claiming it). I am a licensed chemist and currently working in a sugar manufacturing company. 
  
  With a lot of free time from my work, I am learning R programming and video editing. Both of these tasks are completely new to me so I hope to grow myself in this field. Growing up, my passions include reading novels, cooking, studying, gardening, and playing with my cats. I also developed a fascination on quotes and sayings which helped me get by and put any situation in a better perspective. They say I have a boring life but it's the life that is perfect for me. I enjoy staying at home on Fridays than going out for a drink. I would rather spend my time reading than having a hangover. When I am not nerding out, I helped in our family business as a dishwasher, cashier, and a waitress.
